# Nimbus-1st-Year
Hey people! Hope you have completed the work assigned to you for the Nimbus 2k18 app. All this repository is for,  
is to store all our work so that it can be integrated into the main app. Please read the guidelines below on how to add your code into the repository

# How to contribute
1. Start with forking the repo. You know how to do that, obviously.
2. Then clone the forked repo in your own profile.
>git clone https://github.com/utkarshsingh99/Nimbus-1st-Year

3. Now open the cloned repository folder and make a new folder titled with your name on it. 
If you have made the project together with your friend, then write both of your names with a space.
Example, "Vishal Abhinav"

4. Now, in File Explorer, locate **your** project folder, whatever layout or code you have written.
Since its most likely to be written as a complete new project app, copy the entire project folder.

5. Inside the new folder that you have made of your name, paste the entire project folder.

6. Now it's just the basic git commands which you have to do:
```
git add . or git add * 
git commit -m "Added work of <your-name>  
git push origin master
```
7. Open your forked repository on github. There will be a message saying:
```
This branch is 1 commit/n commits ahead of utkarshsingh99:master
```
Right next to the message, click on make Pull Request. 

8. Follow the next steps and you're done!
